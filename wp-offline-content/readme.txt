== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What browsers support the W3C Service Workers API? =
[Browser support for the W3C Service Worker API](http://caniuse.com/#feat=serviceworkers) currently exists in Firefox, Chrome, and Chrome for Android, with other likely to follow.

= What is the default policy for caching content? =
The plugin will try to always serve fresh content from the Internet. After visiting a post or a page, the content will be cached in the background. In case of an unreliable network or lack of connectivity, the plugin will serve the cached content.

= Can I use the plugin in combination with other plugins using SW =

= Can I configure which content is available for offline reading? =
In a very limited way, yes. You can enable/disable if pages should be precached in such a way they will be available by the user even if they were never visited before.

= Does this plugin modify my theme files? =

Absolutely not -- no files are modified or generated by this plugin.

It's best to update the plugin file options when you've added a new file to your theme that you'd like cached.  Files that change or are deleted will be automatically detected and will not create problems within the service worker.

More options will be available with new versions of the plugin.
